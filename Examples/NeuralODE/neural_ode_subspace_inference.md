# Subpace Inference for Neural ODE's

Ordinary differential equations and machine learning are used to model any non linear systems. Consider a system with input `x` and output `y`, the system representation uisng machine learning will be as below
$$
	x^2 = x*x
$$
The training process in machine learning optimizes the paramters of neural network to generate likelihood out to the actual. This machine learning modelling can be used for non linear system by referring universal approximation(UA) theorem. Acording to UA, with enough layers or enough parameters ML representation can approximate any nonlinear function sufficiently close. But the machine learning models requires large set of training data for the proper modelling.

Another solution is to you ordinary differential equations. For ODE base representation, knowledge about the structure of the system is necessary. For example, the birth rate of a prey in a habitat is depends on current population.

$$E_0=mc^2$$.

The `Î±` is a learnable parameter and the solution of the ODE is `prey_population(t0)e
